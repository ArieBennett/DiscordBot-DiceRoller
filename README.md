# DiscordBot-DiceRoller
## Description
Personal Project to create a Discord Bot that can roll dice, etc. for tabletop games
## How to run
This requires Node.js to run the bot. https://nodejs.org/en/
1. Download/clone this repository
2. Start a Discord App
3. Start a Discord Bot for that app. Take the token from this new Discord Bot and place it in config.json by replacing "X" with "{your token}".
4. Invite the Discord Bot you created to your Discord Server.
5. Using the command prompt and Node.js, navigate to the downloaded "DiscordBot-DiceRoller" directory. Enter the following lines of code:
   1) `npm install discord.js` // first time only
   2) `node index.js`          // if this is successful the console will say "Ready!"
6. You should now be able to access the Bot in your Server by using the prefix set in the config.json file.
